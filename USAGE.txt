FIRST START

metasploit is very easy to use, once you have downloaded the archive just write "msfconsole"
on the console and start using it, for
a further guide you can consult
https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/exploits/

UPDATING

to update metasploit, you should delete the old repository and install 
the current one, if you want I added a .bat file for windows, which clones the repository automatically, the old repository 
however, needs to be deleted manually.
